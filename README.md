# Frontend Assessment

Takes in a JSON array called projects. Displays them and lets you sort and filter projects as needed.
## Getting Started :fire:

In the project directory, run:

``` npm install ```

``` npm start ```

``` json-server --watch projects.json ```

This creates a API endpoint that you can access at http://localhost:3000/projects

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
